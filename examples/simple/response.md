The most likely cause is RUNNING_OUT_OF_INODES.

Given the presence of two separate events (eventid: '2142362' and eventid: '2142341') both indicating that the '/var' partition on host 'nelson' is running out of free inodes, it suggests that there may be a persistent issue with disk space management. This could be due to various reasons such as:

1. Inadequate monitoring or maintenance of disk usage leading to a gradual decline in available inodes.
2. High activity from processes or users consuming disk space excessively.

The subsequent event (eventid: '2142364') where the GET request to http://nelson.lib.berkeley.edu:8080/ failed is likely related to this issue, as a server running out of free inodes would be unable to handle network requests effectively, leading to connection timeouts or failures.
//
// Suggested solutions:
//
// 1.  **Immediate action**: Run a disk cleanup on the '/var' partition by deleting unnecessary files and considering resizing the partition if necessary.
// 2.  **Long-term fix**: Implement automated monitoring for disk usage and inode availability, setting up alerts when thresholds are met (e.g., free inodes < 20%).
// 3.  **Identify high consumption processes**: Regularly run system checks to identify and address any processes or users that are consuming excessive disk space.
// 4.  **Schedule regular maintenance**: Schedule routine disk cleanups and monitoring to prevent inode depletion from happening again.
//
// These actions will help mitigate the effects of inode exhaustion, improve system responsiveness, and ensure smoother operation for the host 'nelson'.
