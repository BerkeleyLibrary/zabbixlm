The most likely cause is file system issues, specifically disk space and inode exhaustion on the 'nelson' host.

From the provided events, we can see that there are multiple events related to 'Running out of free inodes (free < 10%)' on the 'nelson' host with event IDs 2142362 and 2142341. This indicates a potential issue with disk space or inode exhaustion on this system.

Additionally, the first event provided, with ID 2142364, reports a failed HTTP request to the server at nelson.lib.berkeley.edu:8080. While this could be a networking issue or a problem with the server itself, it's possible that the root cause is related to the file system issues on the 'nelson' host.

Given these two pieces of information together, it seems likely that the HTTP request failed due to some underlying issue with the server's ability to serve requests, which in turn may be caused by the disk space and inode exhaustion issues.

To resolve this issue, I would suggest checking the disk usage on the 'nelson' host using tools like `df` or `df -i` to determine which directories are consuming the most space and inodes. It's possible that some files or logs are taking up too much space, causing the inode exhaustion.

Once the disk usage is understood, it may be necessary to clean up unnecessary files, delete large files or logs, or even add more storage space to the system to resolve the issue.
