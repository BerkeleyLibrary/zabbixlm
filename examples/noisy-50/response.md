The most likely cause is `ROOT_CAUSE: Running out of free inodes on host 'nelson'`.

Upon examining the reported problems, I notice that several events with event IDs 2142341 and 2142362 have been generated from the same host 'nelson', reporting that the `/var` filesystem is running out of free inodes. This issue can cause various system-level problems, including failed HTTP requests.

The fact that these error messages are being repeated suggests that the underlying problem has not been resolved. Therefore, I recommend investigating and addressing the inode space issue on host 'nelson' as a priority.

Suggested solutions:

1. Check the disk usage on the `/var` filesystem using `df -h` to identify if there is indeed a shortage of free inodes.
2. Run the command `df -i` to display information about file system disk space, including the number of inodes available and used.
3. If the issue persists, consider increasing the inode count by resizing the filesystem or adding more storage capacity.
4. Monitor the disk usage closely to prevent similar issues from arising in the future.

The seemingly random data with nonsensical messages is likely a result of a bug in the monitoring system that is generating these events. It's essential to identify and correct this issue to ensure accurate reporting of system problems.
